🚀 Building Systems That Scale | Automating the Boring | Shipping Clean Code

Hi, I’m Shahm Ebido — I design, build, and ship scalable systems that just work. From API to UI, from pipeline to prod.

🔧 Tech I Speak Fluently:
	•	Backend: Java | Kotlin | Spring Boot | Python | REST | Clean Architecture
	•	Frontend: TypeScript | JavaScript | Angular | Reactive Patterns
	•	Testing: Cypress | Spring Boot Test | CI-first Mentality
	•	AI/ML: Applied ML | Task-specific AI apps | Integration into real-world systems

 💼 What I Do Best:
	•	Architecting robust APIs & microservices
	•	End-to-end feature delivery with frontend & backend integration
	•	Embedding AI into applications with business value
	•	Writing clean, testable, production-grade code
