ðŸš€ Building Systems That Scale | Automating the Boring | Shipping Clean Code

Hi, Iâ€™m Shahm Ebido â€” I design, build, and ship scalable systems that just work. From API to UI, from pipeline to prod.

ðŸ”§ Tech I Speak Fluently:

- Backend: Java | Kotlin | Spring Boot | Python | REST | Clean Architecture
- Frontend: TypeScript | JavaScript | Angular | Reactive Patterns
- Testing: Cypress | Spring Boot Test | CI-first Mentality
- AI/ML: Applied ML | Task-specific AI apps | Integration into real-world systems

 ðŸ’¼ What I Do Best:
 
- Architecting robust APIs & microservices
- End-to-end feature delivery with frontend & backend integration
- Embedding AI into applications with business value
- Writing clean, testable, production-grade code
